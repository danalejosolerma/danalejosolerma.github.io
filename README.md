### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
 **TotalEnergies, Palaiseau, France**   
  	*Trainee - Solar Photovoltaics (May 2024 - Present)*

  - I am currently developing a machine learning model for the forecasting of solar irradiance in solar farms using data recollected from satellite images, sky imagers and irradiance historical data.

  _Tech stack: Python, Pytorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, OpenCV_

  **Onepoint, Paris, France**   
	 *Consultant data engineering/AI (June 2022 - Jan 2023)* 
	 
   - Conducted an in-depth analysis and documentation of an internal database aimed at optimizing the recruitment process, resulting in a improvement in candidate selection.
   - Mapped and analyzed a comprehensive database to develop a robust framework for estimating market size and market share across the Americas for a multinational corporation.

  _Tech stack: Python, Excel_

  **LEEL lab, CEA, Saclay, France**   
	 *Research Engineer - Machine Learning (Jun 2020 - Oct 2021)*
  
   - Co-developed a ML python code for the prediction of chemical composition and thickness of mineral samples, obtaining accuracies between 2% and 10% depending on the quality of the simulated data.
   - Developed a ML python code for the analysis of hyperspectral images and implemented algorithms for anomaly detection, reducing the analysis time by a factor of 20.
   - Construction, training, testing, optimization and deployment of neural networks.
   - Presented at conferences and wrote scientific publications.
